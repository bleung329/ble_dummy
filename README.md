# ble_dummy
A dummy project for learning Zephyr's BLE capabilities. Still a WIP.

<h2>What it does:</h2>
A simple peripheral that turns on an LED when someone connects. Allows basic read/write as well.
Meant to be skeleton code for BLE, hence the lack of security and error checking. Don't actually use this in production.
